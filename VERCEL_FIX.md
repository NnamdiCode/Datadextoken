# ðŸ”§ Vercel Deployment Fix

## The Problem
Your current deployment at `https://datadex-smoky.vercel.app/` is showing server code instead of your React app because Vercel is trying to execute Node.js server files in the browser.

## The Solution
I've created a fixed configuration that builds only the frontend and deploys it correctly.

## What You Need to Do

### 1. Commit the Fix
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment - pure frontend build configuration"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Redeploy on Vercel
Go to your Vercel dashboard and either:

**Option A: Redeploy with New Settings**
1. Go to your project settings on Vercel
2. Navigate to "Build & Output Settings"
3. Override these settings:
   - **Build Command**: `vite build --config vite.config.production.ts`
   - **Output Directory**: `dist/public`
   - **Install Command**: `npm install`
4. Click "Save" and redeploy

**Option B: Create New Deployment**
1. Delete the current deployment
2. Import the repository again
3. Use the build settings above

### 3. What Fixed It

**New `vercel.json` configuration:**
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "vite build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist/public",
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "framework": "vite",
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

**New production build config (`vite.config.production.ts`):**
- Builds only frontend code
- Outputs to `dist/public` (not `dist`)
- Excludes all server-side code
- Proper routing for single-page app

## Result
Your app will work in **demo mode** showing:
- Sample data tokens (Weather Data, Financial Dataset, Medical Research)
- Mock trading functionality
- Full UI/UX experience
- Wallet connection capability
- All visual effects and charts

Users can test the complete application flow without needing a backend server.

## Verification
After redeployment, your site should show:
- âœ… DataSwap homepage with glass effects
- âœ… Sample tokens in the marketplace
- âœ… Working navigation and trading interface
- âœ… No more Node.js server code errors

The fix ensures Vercel only serves your React frontend, not server files.
